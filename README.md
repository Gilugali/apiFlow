# ApiFlow API Documentation - ApiFlow Builder

ApiFlow Builder is a simple, web-based tool designed to help developers quickly create ApiFlow documentation for their APIs. The platform generates necessary ApiFlow JSON files, which can be used to describe the structure and endpoints of your RESTful API.

## Installation and Setup

To use apiFlow Builder for your project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the apiFlow Builder repository to your local machine:
bash
git clone https://github.com/Gilugali/apiFlow.git

2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project folder and install the required dependencies:

cd apiFlow
npm install

3. Run the Application

Start the apiFlow application locally:

npm start

The app will run on http://localhost:3000, where you can open a browser to begin building your API documentation.
# Usage

Once the application is running: 1. Open the web-based GUI interface by visiting http://localhost:3000. 2. In the interface, you can start adding your API details:
• Base URL: Define the base URL for your API.
• Paths: Add each endpoint, along with HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
• Parameters: Define any parameters each endpoint might accept.
• Responses: Specify the response structure and status codes. 3. You can save your apiFlow API documentation as a JSON file using the “Export” button in the GUI. This JSON file can be integrated into apiFlow UI or used with tools like Postman for API testing.


# How It Works

    1.	API Flow: apiFlow Builder simplifies the API design process by providing an easy interface to define 
        endpoints, parameters, and responses. It automatically generates the corresponding apiFlow JSON.
    2.	Customization: You can customize the API documentation by editing the JSON directly or modifying fields 
        through the GUI.
    3.	Exporting: After building your API documentation, you can export the apiFlow JSON file, which can be used 
        with tools like apiFlow UI to create interactive API documentation.
